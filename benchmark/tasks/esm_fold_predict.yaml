  Generate the representation of a protein sequence and the contact map using Facebook Research's pretrained esm2_t33_650M_UR50D model.
arguments:
  sequence:
    description: Protein sequence to for which to generate representation and contact map.
    type: str
returns:
  sequence_representation:
    description: Token representations for the protein sequence as a list of floats, i.e. a 1D array of shape L where L is the number of tokens.
    type: list
  contact_map:
    description: Contact map for the protein sequence as a list of list of floats, i.e. a 2D array of shape LxL where L is the number of tokens.

note: >-
  We can very simply ask the model to reconstruct one of the example functions from the README
  (see: `After pip install, you can load and use a pretrained model as follows:`). 
  This repository does not contain any simple CLI functions, but examples. 
  For now we ask it to re-implement one of the examples.
